# Business Analytics Student Survey Form

## Description
This project is a multi-page web form created for the Business Analytics Student Survey assignment. 

## Form Best Practices
This web form follows several best practices to ensure a clear, friendly experience for users. 

The layout is consistent across all pages through the use of the style.css file, which helps with spacing, design, and color. Sections are logically grouped using elements that make the form easier read and successfully complete. Descriptive buttons are in place so users understand how to move between pages.

Best practices include testing for validation. Each page was tested to confirm it is of high quality and eliminate issues. Additionally, the thank you page follows best practices. It alerts users when the survey is done so they can leave the experience knowing the process was successfully completed.
